# X, Y coordinate of the nozzle, clicking on the z endstop. (e.g. 100,100)

# A X, Y coordinate of the probe's switch body, clicking on the z endstop.
switch_xy_position: 229.00,328.50

# Instead of an absolute position (switch_xy_position), this configuration adds an X, Y offset (e.g. -6,-18) to the nozzle position.
# switch_xy_offsets: optional when switch_xy_position is used

# A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the print surface (e.g. the center point) is probed. These coordinates are adjusted by the probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the zero_reference_position which replaces the deprecated relative_reference_index of the configured bed_mesh, if configured. It's possible to change the zero reference position at runtime or use the GCode argument BED_POSITION of CALIBRATE_Z.
bed_xy_position: 175,175

# After probing the nozzle and retracting, move x some distance away and back. Useful to prevent the z endstop pin sticking to the nozzle and being pulled out of the assembly. Can be negative. Defaults to zero to disable it. Can be combined in x and y to move diagonally. Be careful to not move your nozzle out of range!
wiggle_xy_offsets: 0,0
   
# The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch. A larger value will position the nozzle closer to the bed. This must be determined manually. Qick Hint: Remember, the smaller the switch-offset, the further the nozzle is away from the bed!
switch_offset: 0.5

# The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset. If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop! The default is 1.0 mm.   
offset_margins: -4.0,4.0

# The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
# samples: default from "probe:samples" section

# The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
# samples_tolerance: default from "probe:samples_tolerance" section

# The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
# samples_tolerance_retries: default from "probe:samples_tolerance_retries" section

# The calculation method when sampling more than once - either "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
# samples_result: default from "probe:samples_result" section

# The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's configuration.
# safe_z_height: default is 2 * z_offset from the "probe:z_offset" section

# Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
# position_min: default from "stepper_z:position_min" section.

# The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.

#  Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's configuration.
# lift_speed: default from "probe:lift_speed" section

# The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast is enabled. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
# probing_speed: default from "stepper_z:homing_speed" section.

# The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples. The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
# probing_second_speed: default from "stepper_z:second_homing_speed" section.

# Distance to retract (in mm) before probing the next sample. The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration. Caution: if sensorless homing is used on the Z axis with homing_retract_dist set to zero, this must be set to a value greater zero.
# probing_retract_dist: default from "stepper_z:homing_retract_dist" section.

# If true, the first probing will be faster by the probing speed. This is to get down faster and not record the result as a probing sample. The default is false.
